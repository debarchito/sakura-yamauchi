#### 1) About the Change

This is actually a re-implementation of the bot. I've switched from Node.js (`discord.js`) to Deno
(`harmony`). Why? Well mostly personal preferences and some grudges against `discord.js`. Anyway, the
structure is simplified now and is truly TypeScript-first.

#### 2) Changes to Goals

With the original implementation, I wanted to make a bot that would one day be a part of thousands
of servers. But that is not the case anymore. I spent way too much time engineering the structure of
the codebase than actually writing some useful code + I don't really get much time to work on it. But,
I want to continue. So now, I'll focus more on building a bot for my friends and I. Since the
source-code is open-source, you are free to fork it, tune it to your needs and self-host it. But
yeah, I still plan to make it a multi-purpose bot :P...like the only bot I'll ever need! The pace
maybe be slow but will be consistent (or maybe consistent is not the right word...more like huge
commits once a month or two? XD).

#### 3) What happens to the old code?

Well, I('ll) force push(ed) the new code so yeah, goodbye old code~

#### 4) Why "Sakura Yamauchi"?

Well, umm...cause I like the name...? Fine. Yeah, Sakura is my fav female anime character and I
really loved the movie (shameless plug: Go watch the movie `I want to eat your pancreas`).
